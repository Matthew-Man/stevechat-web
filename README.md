# Stevechat Web - WIP

Personal project building a web based chat app using the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/), Facebook's JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), Microsoft's extension of JavaScript for large-scale applications
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), Vercel's React framework for static and server rendering
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), Component library for simple, modular and accessible building blocks

Design was influenced by a [Messaging UI Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/15568094-Messaging-Dark-Light-Theme-Exploration) created by Sandro Tavartkiladze
